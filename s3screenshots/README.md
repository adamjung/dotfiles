WIP.

This will ultimately probably end up in a new git repo.

### Installation

Copy `s3screenshots.sh.sample` to `s3screenshots.sh`.

Add your AWS credentials, bucket name, and OS X username.

Copy `com.kortina.s3screenshots.plist` to a new file, replacing `kortina` with your OS X username.

Replace all instances of `kortina` in `com.kortina.s3screenshots.plist` with your OS X username.

Copy your plist file to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`.
