# This example will return both the URL and title for the frontmost tab of the active browser, separated by a newline.
# Keep in mind that by using `using terms from`, weâ€™re basically requiring that referenced browser to be available on the system
# (i.e., to use this on "Google Chrome Canary" or "Chromium", "Google Chrome" needs to be installed).
# This is required to be able to use a variable in `tell application`. If it is undesirable, the accompanying example should be used instead.
